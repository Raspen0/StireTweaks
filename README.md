StireTweaks
=================

This mod contains tweaks for the Stirecraft modpack, a lot of items don't have crafting recipes because minetweaker/modtweaker handles those in the modpack.

This mod was made for the Stirecraft modpack and will not function correctly without Minetweaker scripts and other mods.


Some things are copied and modified from other mods, classes that where copied have a note at the beginning of the class saying from which mod they where copied.

I'm a beginner at java so I copy things to learn from them.
If you're the author of one of these mods and don't want this, please tell me and I'll remove those classes.
